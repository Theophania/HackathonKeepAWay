Hackathon Application 

Devpost link: https://devpost.com/software/keep-a-way
Here we have all the files including the project.

Built with: 
arduino
c
expo.io
javascript
react
react-native
tinkercad

Inspiration
We draw our inspiration from wanting to help people in this time of crisis.

What it does
The application shows numbered markers on the map with how many people are at that specific institution at the current time. If the user needs to buy groceries, he can find a store that is not crowded and can specify that he's going there. The Map then updates for all of our users.

How we built it
We build it for Smartphone with the react-native framework for javascript. The back-end concept we developed would use google firebase and a PIR hardware device (Arduino/C) that should be installed at each institution, in order to see if a user left it.

Challenges we ran into
Learning the react-native framework
backend - frontend connection
Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we learned
What's next for Keep A-way
The user can currently navigate the application, insert text, click buttons and click the markers. Hopefully, if we get positive feedback, we can continue development for this application and actually make it functional. (Right now we don't update anything dynamically and there is not that much user interaction)
